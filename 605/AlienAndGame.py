# PROBLEM STATEMENT
# 
# Alien Fred wants to destroy the Earth.
# But before he does that, he wants to play the following game.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# He has a rectangular board divided into unit cells.
# Each cell is initially painted black or white.
# You are given a tuple (string) board.
# The character board[i][j] represents the cell with coordinates (i, j).
# Each of those characters is either 'B' (representing a black cell) or 'W' (representing a white cell).
# The game is played in turns.
# In each turn Fred can choose any row of the board and repaint all black cells of the row to white, and vice versa.
# (Note that he can only select rows, not columns.
# Formally, he can choose an index i and change all characters of board[i].)
#
#
#
#
# Fred wants to have a large white square somewhere on his board.
# The sides of Fred's square must be parallel to the sides of the board.
# The white square may be a part of a larger white area.
# (I.e., the cells that touch the square may be both black and white.)
# Find a sequence of turns that produces the largest possible white square somewhere on the board, and return the area of that square.
#
#
# DEFINITION
# Class:AlienAndGame
# Method:getNumber
# Parameters:tuple (string)
# Returns:integer
# Method signature:def getNumber(self, board):
# 
# 
# CONSTRAINTS
# -board will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
# -Each element of board will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
# -Each element of board will contain the same number of characters.
# -Each character in each element of board will be either 'B' or 'W'.
# 
# 
# EXAMPLES
# 
# 0)
# {"BB",
#  "WW"}
# 
# Returns: 4
# 
# The optimal strategy is to repaint row 0. After this change the entire board will be white, and thus we have a 2*2 white square.
# 
# 1)
# {"W"}
# 
# Returns: 1
# 
# Sometimes the optimal strategy requires no repainting.
# 
# 2)
# {"WBBB",
#  "WBBB",
#  "WWWW"}
# 
# Returns: 9
# 
# We should repaint row 0 and then repaint row 1. 
# The resulting board will contain a 3*3 white square (in rows 0-2 and columns 1-3).
# 
# 3)
# {"W",
#  "B",
#  "W",
#  "W",
#  "W"}
# 
# Returns: 1
# 
# 
# 
# 4)
# {"BWBBWBB",
#  "WWBWWBW",
#  "BBBBBBW",
#  "WBBBBWB",
#  "BBWWWWB",
#  "WWWWWWW",
#  "BBWWBBB"}
# 
# Returns: 9
